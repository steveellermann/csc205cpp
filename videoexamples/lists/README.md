# Linked Lists

## Introductory videos

These videos give a brief overview of the types of lists and with how linked lists work.  I recommend watching these first, especially before watching the linked list video.

- VIDEO - [Overview of Lists](https://youtu.be/yJaQzOTTtBw) (5:42) gives a general introduction to List data structures and the types of lists.
- VIDEO - [Overview of Linked Lists - Implementation & Operations](https://youtu.be/tDTx50zsji0) (11:33) gives a more specific introduction to Linked Lists.
