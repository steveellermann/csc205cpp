# Recursion & Analysis of Algorithms Module

## Algorithms

- [VIDEO: Algorithms.java](https://youtu.be/T4jLQsUrems) (12:12) shows a comparison of two algorithms for finding the max element in an array.  The algorithms are compared both for the number of comparisons they make and their running time.  This video introduces nanoTime() to get a time stamp and printf() for printing formatted output.
- [VIDEO: AnalyzeLoops.java](https://youtu.be/SYJp3n6OmcI) (9:28) first demonstrates how to analyze methods with loops then gives example methods with a variety of asymptotic complexity.
